1) Loops:
Loops allows a program to repeat through a group of statements until a
terminating condition is met.

2) Iteration:
Each time through a loop's statements is called an iteration.

3) Loop Body:
A loop is a program construct that repeatedly executes the loop's statements
(known as the loop body) while the loop's expression is true; when false, execution
proceeds past the loop.

4) Terminating Condition:
That terminating condition is reached when the loop expression is false.

5) Infinite Loop:
An infinite loop is a loop that never stops iterating. A common error is to
accidentally create an infinite loop, often by forgetting to update a variable in the
body, or by creating a loop expression whose evaluation to false isn't always
reachable.
